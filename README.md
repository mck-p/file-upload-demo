via HTML Forms and Multer.

## Environment Variables

There are some things we can toggle via env vars. See `.env` for more
details

```s

# Set to _anything_ to be to true
# do not set or set to empty to be false
SHOW_UPLOADED_IMAGE=
# if the above is false, what file would
# you like us to serve, based in public/uploads/<name>
HARDCODED_FILENAME=contours-big.png
# what port do you want the system to listen on?
PORT=5000
